## Unofficial email composer for PROG Mag 2020 poll

PROG Mag is <a href='https://www.loudersound.com/news/vote-in-the-2020-prog-magazine-readers-poll' target='_blank'>running a poll</a> among readers, listeners of Progressive Rock and similar music.

The way they run it, though, is a little bit unsettling, considering it's almost 2021: you need to send an email formatted in a certain way.

I mean, I personally love emails and I think they're better than all existing messengers, but... what about normal people? :)

So, I decided to create this email composer to help my listeners and other people to create and send an email in an easy way.

After filling the form you'll have a pre-composed email message in your email app. It works best on smartphones, btw.

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT
PROG Mag is not affiliated with me or with this in any way. No one asked me to create it, it was my pure desire to make our world better.

### ⚠️ EVEN MORE IMPORTANT
This code doesn't send any emails on anyone's behalf. It's basically an <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2368' target='_blank'>email-link</a> generator. A user has to send an email manually from their email app/service after clicking the "Create email" button.
